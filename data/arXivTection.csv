"Recent instruction fine-tuned models can solve multiple NLP tasks when prompted to do so, with machine translation (MT) being a prominent use case. However, current research often focuses on standard performance benchmarks, leaving compelling fairness and ethical considerations behind. In MT, this might lead to misgendered translations, resulting, among other harms, in the perpetuation of stereotypes and prejudices. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether and to what extent such models exhibit gender bias in machine translation and how we can mitigate it.","The latest trained models are able to complete various natural language processing jobs when given the proper prompts, with converting text between languages (machine translation) being a common application. However, current research frequently prioritizes performance on standard benchmarks over important fairness and ethics issues.

"As implied by our previous experiment, the Token DI model acts as a sentence level DI model, tagging all the tokens as dialectal if only one token shows a distinctive dialectal feature.

"Furthermore, after using Tent, the model’s prediction tends to be more and more inclined towards 0, which directly leads to almost all of the model’s predictions being incorrect.

"As the amount of warmup data grows, Anti-CF performs better, and when the amount of warmup data reaches the thousand level, the performance of Anti-CF reaches a plateau.

"Before discussing our evaluation protocol, we first outline two strategies—hierarchical merging and incremental updating—for prompting an LLM to summarize book-length documents that exceed its maximum context size.

Previously, BWS has been deployed for tasks such as relational similarity (Jurgens et al., 2012), word-sense disambiguation (Jurgens, 2013), word–sentiment intensity (Kiritchenko et al., 2014), phrase sentiment composition (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016), and tweet-emotion intensity (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017; Mohammad and Kiritchenko, 2018). Utilizing BWS, we assemble the first dataset of the degree of gender bias scores for GPT-generated text.",A,Fifty Shades of Bias,0
"The choice of a gendered seed significantly often resulted in generating sentences that explicitly express bias.

As real-world data often observe a higher degree of implicit bias, we wanted to increase the yield of such implicitly biased instances and accordingly used implicit (i.e., devoid of any physical quality attribute like "" is stronger"") and gender-agnostic/ neutral seeds (i.e., devoid of gender pronouns).","The selection of a gender-specific starting point frequently led to the creation of sentences that clearly convey prejudice. In particular, the system had an inclination to either make a contrary to fact statement or a typical biased characteristic linkage in these examples.

They are trained for single-step sample generation, while retaining crucial strengths of diffusion models such as trading compute for sample quality through multi-step sampling, and zero-shot data editing abilities.",A,Improved Techniques for Training Consistency Models,0
" We can train consistency models using either consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). The former requires pre-training a diffusion model and distilling the knowledge therein into a consistency model. The latter allows us to train consistency models directly from data, establishing them as an independent family of generative models. Previous work (Song et al., 2023) demonstrates that CD significantly outperforms CT. However, CD adds computational overhead to the training process since it requires learning a separate diffusion model. Additionally, distillation limits the sample quality of the consistency model to that of the diffusion model.","We have two options for teaching consistency models - consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). CD means first pre-educating a diffusion model and moving that knowledge into a consistency model. CT lets us educate consistency models straight from information, making them their own type of generative model. Earlier research (Song et al., 2023) shows CD is much better than CT. However, CD makes training more complex since we have to build a separate diffusion model. Also, distillation restricts the consistency model's sample quality to the diffusion model's level.","There are two ways to develop consistency models - consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). CD requires first constructing a diffusion model and transferring its knowledge to a consistency model. CT enables directly training consistency models from scratch as their own generative model family. Past work (Song et al., 2023) proves CD greatly surpasses CT in performance. But CD adds computational burden during training by needing a distinct diffusion model. And distillation limits the consistency model's sample quality to that of the diffusion model.

Initially, iCT approaches surpass previous diffusion distillation methods in both one-step and two-step generation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64, all while avoiding the necessity to train diffusion models. ","As highlighted by Kynkäänniemi and colleagues (2023), this can distort FIDs and yield overstated sample quality. Procedures relying on LPIPS have analogous issues, since LPIPS is also pre-trained on ImageNet. We have included these methods in Tables 2 and 3 for thoroughness, however we do not view them as direct alternatives to iCT or iCT-deep procedures. A few principal takeaways emerge from Tables 2 and 3. Firstly, iCT techniques exceed prior diffusion distillation approaches in both one-step and two-step generation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64, all without necessitating training diffusion models.",A,Improved Techniques for Training Consistency Models,0
"Secondly, iCT models demonstrate sample quality comparable to many leading generative models, including diffusion models and GANs. For instance, with one-step generation, iCT-deep obtains FIDs of 2.51 and 3.25 for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet respectively, whereas DDPMs (Ho et al., 2020) necessitate thousands of sampling steps to reach FIDs of 3.17 and 11.0 (result taken from Gu et al. (2023)) on both datasets. The one-step FID for iCT already exceeds that of StyleGAN-ADA (Karras et al., 2020b) on CIFAR-10, and that of BigGAN-deep (Brock et al., 2019) on ImageNet 64´64, let alone iCT-deep models. For two-step generation, iCT-deep records an FID of 2.24, matching Score SDE in Song et al.

"With the development of fast sampling algorithms, it is crucial that E-TSDM can be effectively combined with classic fast samplers, such as DDIM (Song et al., 2020) and DPM-Solver (Lu et al., 2022b). To this end, we incorporate both DDIM (Song et al., 2020) and DPM-Solver (Lu et al., 2022b) into E-TSDM for fast sampling in this section. It is worth noting that the presence of large Lipschitz constants can have a more detrimental impact on the efficiency of fast sampling compared to full-timestep sampling, as numerical solvers typically depend on the similarity between function values and their derivatives on adjacent steps. When using fast sampling algorithms with larger discretization steps, it becomes necessary for the functions to exhibit better smoothness, which in turn corresponds to smaller Lipschitz constants. Hence, it is anticipated that the utilization of ETSDM will lead to an improvement in the generation performance of fast sampling methods.","As fast sampling techniques like DDIM (Song et al., 2020) and DPM-Solver (Lu et al., 2022b) have matured, integrating E-TSDM with these classic fast sampling methods has become imperative.

"The generative inference of LLMs usually involves using the KV Cache mechanism to enhance the generation speed. KV cache stores previously computed Key/Value vectors in attention calculation and reuses those values for the current token generation.

"Once prompt encoding finished, LLMs conduct incremental token generation. At each generation step, the model only needs to encode the newly generated tokens from the last step. Furthermore, after a new token being generated, its associated key and value vectors are appended to the current KV cache. Consequently, the KV cache’s size experiences a linear surge in tandem with the generation of additional tokens.","When the initial encoding of the prompt ends, large language models start creating tokens one by one. At each point where a new token is made, the model just has to encode the tokens created since the last step. Also, after a new token is formed, its matching key and value vectors get added to the present KV store. As a result, the size of the KV store grows linearly as more and more tokens are created.","After the prompt has been encoded, the large language models begin token generation incrementally.

"Fine-tuning approaches to few-shot adaptation must manage a trade-off between adapting a large or small number of parameters. The former allows for better adaptation, but risks overfitting on a few-shot training set. The latter reduces the risk of overfitting, but limits the capacity for adaptation to novel categories and domains.

"Most importantly, both variants of our NFTS substantially outperform the baselines, demonstrating the value of our overall framework compared to mainstream fixed fine-tuning patterns. Next, we can compare our top-1 adaptation architecture selection strategy against our progressive approach that defers the final architecture selection to an episode-wise decision (i.e., NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N). Our deferred architecture selection improves upon fixing the top-1 architecture from meta-train, especially for the single source domain case. This is intuitive, because NAS on a single source domain (cf., multi-domain) condition is most at risk of over-tuning to that domain, and should benefit the most from learning and transferring a diverse pool of architectures to the target domains.","Most significantly, our two versions of the NFTS model considerably surpass the baseline models, showing the value of our general framework over typical fixed fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, we can contrast our technique of selecting the top architecture from meta-training to our progressive tactic which delays the final architecture choice to a per-episode decision (NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N). Putting off the architecture selection improves on fixing the top meta-training architecture, especially for adapting from a single source domain. This makes sense, as NAS with just one source domain (vs. multiple) is most prone to over-fitting that domain, so should benefit most from learning and transferring a diverse set of architectures to the target domains.","In summary, both forms of our NFTS model substantially outdo the baseline models, demonstrating the superiority of our framework compared to conventional fixed fine-tuning methods. In addition, we can compare our approach of choosing the top-ranked architecture from meta-training to our gradual tactic that postpones the final architecture decision to a per-episode selection (NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N). Delaying the architecture pick improves on locking in the top meta-training architecture, particularly for adapting from a solitary source domain. This is logical, because NAS with a single source domain (versus multiple) is most susceptible to over-specializing to that domain, so should profit most from learning and transferring a diverse collection of architectures to the target domains.","Above all, both versions of our NFTS model considerably eclipse the baseline models, exhibiting the advantages of our framework over typical static fine-tuning techniques. Moreover, we can contrast our strategy of selecting the highest-ranked architecture from meta-training to our incremental approach that puts off the final architecture choice to a per-episode decision (NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N).

Drawing inspiration from recent improvements in non-autoregressive text generation (Libovicky and Helcl, 2018; Saharia et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022b), here we propose a new approach for editing text that satisfies the aforementioned expectations by making a straightforward yet potent extension to connectionist temporal classification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006).",A,Non-autoregressive Text Editing with Copy-aware Latent Alignments,0

Visual dialogue (Das et al., 2017) was proposed to learn to communicate with users based on one simple image, making the visual knowledge very limited for a multi-turn dialogue session. ","Having real experiences in common often helps people communicate better (Bisk et al., 2020). Just using words can fail to convey all someone knows about the world well (Harnad, 1990). Visual signals are key for sharing experiences and having high-quality talks. As people chat daily, they tend to group info into smaller memory chunks as images. That's why adding visual perceptions to chat systems could make the chats better. Chatting about one image was proposed to learn to talk to users (Das et al., 2017). But that gives limited visual knowledge for a multi-turn session.","Effective communication frequently requires shared real-world experiences between speakers (Bisk et al., 2020). Mere text can be insufficient to accurately convey rich world knowledge (Harnad, 1990), where visual cues are vital to share experiences and have high-quality conversations. As humans converse daily, they naturally group information into smaller memory chunks through images. This explains why incorporating visual perceptions in dialogue systems could potentially elevate the conversation quality. Dialogue about a single image was proposed to learn to converse with users (Das et al., 2017), but this provides limited visual knowledge for a multi-turn dialogue session.  ","Productive linguistic communication often necessitates common real-life experiences between interlocutors (Bisk et al., 2020). Plain text alone may be inadequate to accurately impart comprehensive world knowledge (Harnad, 1990), for which visual signals are indispensable to share experiences and conduct high-grade conversations. As human beings confer daily, they habitually categorize information into smaller memory segments via images. That accounts for why integrating visual perceptions in conversation systems could potentially enhance the discussion quality. Dialogue centered on a solitary illustration was devised to learn to engage users (Das et al., 2017), yet this allows scant visual knowledge for a multi-turn dialogue interaction.",A,RESEE,0
"In order to enhance the dialogue quality by providing larger capacity and flexibility of visual information, recent works have considered employing multiple images and image searching processes to better align with the dialogue context.  Even so, they are confined to retrieving images on a coarse-grained dialogue concept (e.g., session-level) or leverage inaccurate visual knowledge searched from inadequate image resources (Liang et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021).  To sum up, current works have two main issues that may compromise the performance of multimodal dialogue.  (1) Coarse-grained visual knowledge:  existing multimodal dialogues mostly follow the framework of image-grounded conversation, which inherently provides insufficient visual knowledge (one image) and leaves lots of details unexploited for a complete conversation. ","In order to improve the quality of conversation by offering more capacity and adaptability of visual data, recent works have looked at using multiple images and image searching techniques to better match the context of the dialogue.

In summary, current works have two main problems that may affect the performance of multimodal dialogue. (1) Coarse-grained visual knowledge: existing multimodal dialogues mostly follow the framework of image-based conversation, which inherently provides insufficient visual knowledge (one image) and misses many details that could be exploited for a full conversation.","To enhance the quality of dialogue by providing more capacity and flexibility of visual information, recent efforts have considered using multiple images and image search processes to better fit with the dialogue context.

"(2) Potentially inaccurate visual knowledge:  though recent explorations come up with using fine-grained images, they are limited in searching from small-scale image caption datasets (e.g., Shen et al.  (2021) employs Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014) for this process).  These defects will introduce knowledge bias into the system (e.g., entity images retrieved from Flickr30k may be wrong or monotonous w.r.t.  given entities in Figure 2) and impair the conversational skills of a dialogue agent.  To overcome the above two shortcomings, we believe:  (1) Compared with session-level visual knowledge, fine-grained visual knowledge such as entity-level image is more competent to help models build a comprehensive understanding of ongoing conversations. ","Though recent explorations utilize detailed images, they are constrained to small image caption datasets (e.g. Shen et al. (2021) uses Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014)). These flaws bring biased knowledge into the system (e.g. entity images from Flickr30k may be inaccurate or monotonous compared to Figure 2 entities) and weaken conversational abilities. To address these issues, we believe: (1) Unlike session visuals, fine details like entity images build more comprehensive understanding of conversations.","While new research leverages granular images, it is limited to small image description sets (Shen et al. (2021) uses Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014)). These problems introduce prejudice into the system (e.g. entity photos from Flickr30k could be wrong or repetitive relative to Figure 2) and impair dialogue skills. To fix this: (1) Unlike session visuals, precise entity images better aid comprehensive conversation understanding.","Although recent work utilizes specific images, it relies on tiny image annotation datasets (e.g. Shen et al.

"We thus propose to explicitly divide the visual standard of a dialogue session into turn-level and entity-level.  (2) Instead of matching photos from existing image sets, we search images on the internet for every entity to obtain accurate and diverse visual representations accordingly.  To justify the advantage of our approach in obtaining pictures with higher quality, we randomly sample 50 entities from existing dialogue data and either search corresponding images from the internet or retrieve them from a large image corpus with over 150K images.1 We further conduct a human evaluation to quantify entity-image relevance. ","Therefore, we suggest clearly separating the visual norms of a conversation session into turn-by-turn and entity-by-entity levels.

Analogously, we adopt the format of verifying comprehension statements with regards to an opinionated review text.","To really determine if a model can grasp the feeling and intricacies of emotion in text, a more comprehensive method is needed rather than just predicting if the text is positive or negative. We created a new sentiment analysis task called SOUL to do this. It was modeled after reading comprehension tests which evaluate if people understand a passage by asking if a statement about it is correct. Similarly, we test understanding of opinionated reviews by asking if statements about them are true.",A,SOUL,0

"We argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches. The major limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training.

Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying finetuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.","We make the case that existing methods constrain the capability of the pre-trained representations, especially for fine-tuning techniques.

For instance, in OpenAI GPT, the creators use a left-to-right design, where each token can just go to past tokens in the self-consideration layers of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).

"In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a “masked language model” (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-toright language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pretrain a deep bidirectional Transformer.

In real situations, keeping everything the same is probably not ideal, but our rethinking could help get the problem ready. If the optimal function is more like keeping everything the same than making everything zero, it should be simpler for the solver to find the small tweaks compared to keeping everything the same, than to learn the function from nothing.

This approach is inspired by prior unifying frameworks for NLP tasks, including framing all text problems as question answering, language modeling, or span extraction tasks.","The rapid pace of improvements and variety of techniques in this rapidly growing field can make it tough to compare different algorithms, disentangle the effects of new contributions, and understand the landscape of existing methods for transfer learning. Driven by a need for more rigorous understanding, we employ a unified approach to transfer learning that allows us to methodically examine different approaches and push the current frontiers of the field. The fundamental notion behind our work is to treat every text processing problem as a ""text-to-text"" problem, meaning taking text as input and generating new text as output. This approach is inspired by earlier unifying frameworks for NLP tasks, including casting all text problems as question answering, language modeling, or span extraction tasks.",A,Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer,1

The negatives are mostly that pg(x) is not directly depicted, and D needs to be well coordinated with G during learning (specifically, G can't be trained excessively without refreshing D, to avoid ""the Helvetica case"" where G maps too many z values to the same x value to have sufficient diversity to represent pdata), similar to how the negative chains of a Boltzmann machine must be kept current between learning phases.","This newly presented framework has some advantages and drawbacks relative to prior modeling approaches. The drawbacks are primarily the lack of explicit representation for pg(x), and the need to synchronize D closely with G during training (in particular, avoiding overtraining G without updating D, which can lead to ""the Helvetica scenario"" where G maps too many z values to the same x value to adequately capture diversity for modeling pdata), analogous to keeping the negative chains updated in a Boltzmann machine. ","This newly introduced architecture has some pros and cons compared to previous modeling frameworks.

The main idea of the Inception architecture is based on finding out how an optimal local sparse structure in a convolutional vision network can be approximated and covered by readily available dense components.

"This enables adapting and fine-tuning our networks for other label sets easily, but it is mostly convenience and we do not expect it to have a major effect. It was found that a move from fully connected layers to average pooling improved the top-1 accuracy by about 0.6%, however the use of dropout remained essential even after removing the fully connected layers.

"Learning to perform a single task can be expressed in a probabilistic framework as estimating a conditional distribution p(output|input). Since a general system should be able to perform many different tasks, even for the same input, it should condition not only on the input but also on the task to be performed. That is, it should model p(output|input, task). This has been variously formalized in multitask and meta-learning settings. Task conditioning is often implemented at an architectural level, such as the task specific encoders and decoders in (Kaiser et al., 2017) or at an algorithmic level such as the inner and outer loop optimization framework of MAML (Finn et al., 2017).","Acquiring the skills to carry out a solitary chore can be depicted using probability theory as approximating a conditional distribution p(result|data).

After learning the conditional distribution, the translation model can generate a translation for a source sentence by choosing the sentence with the highest conditional probability.",A,Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning To Align and Translate,1

"One of the motivations behind the proposed approach was the use of a fixed-length context vector in the basic encoder–decoder approach.

RNNsearch50, especially, shows no performance deterioration even with sentences of length 50 or more. This superiority of the proposed model over the basic encoder–decoder is further confirmed by the fact that the RNNsearch-30 even outperforms RNNencdec-50 (see Table 1).","A key inspiration for the suggested method was the use of an unchanging context vector in the standard encoder-decoder model.

Especially RNNsearch50 displays no performance deterioration even at 50+ words per sentence. This proposed model's superiority over basic encoder-decoder is further validated by RNNsearch-30 outperforming RNNencdec-50 (see Table 1).","One impetus for the proposed technique was the static context vector employed in the basic encoder-decoder framework.

BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a pre-trained transformer network (Vaswani et al., 2017), which set for various NLP tasks new state-of-the-art results, including question answering, sentence classification, and sentence-pair regression. The input for BERT for sentence-pair regression consists of the two sentences, separated by a special [SEP] token. Multi-head attention over 12 (base-model) or 24 layers (large-model) is applied and the output is passed to a simple regression function to derive the final label.

"RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) showed, that the performance of BERT can further improved by small adaptations to the pre-training process. We also tested XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), but it led in general to worse results than BERT. A large disadvantage of the BERT network structure is that no independent sentence embeddings are computed, which makes it difficult to derive sentence embeddings from BERT.

A significant drawback of BERT's architecture is the lack of independent sentence embeddings, making it challenging to extract sentence vectors from BERT.

[1], who amalgamate an NNLM with a topic model of the input sentence, which enhances re-ranking performance.  ","A substantial body of research exists on applications of neural networks to automated translation. Up until now, the most uncomplicated and fruitful approach to applying a Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM) [23] or a Feedforward Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) [3] to a machine translation task has been through re-ordering the n-best lists from a robust baseline machine translation system [22], which consistently improves translation accuracy.

In particular, a trainable neural network is employed to encode the context x<t into a constant size hidden representation, which is multiplied with the word vectors to obtain the logits. The logits are then input to the Softmax function, producing a categorical probability distribution over the next token. To apply Transformer or self-attention to language modeling, the central challenge is how to train a Transformer to effectively encode an arbitrarily long context into a fixed size representation. With unlimited memory and computation, a simple solution would be to process the entire context sequence using an unconditional Transformer decoder, similar to a feedforward neural network.","In this work, we adhere to the conventional neural approach for modeling the conditional probability. Specifically, a trainable neural network is used to encode the context x<t into a fixed dimension latent state, which is multiplied with the word embeddings to get the logits. The logits are then passed to the Softmax function, yielding a categorical probability distribution over the next token. To apply Transformer or self-attention to language modeling, the core problem is how to train a Transformer to efficiently encode an arbitrarily long context into a fixed size representation.

"One feasible but crude approximation is to split the entire corpus into shorter segments of man-ageable sizes, and only train the model within each segment, ignoring all contextual information from previous segments. This is the idea adopted by Al-Rfou et al. (2018). We call it the vanilla model and visualize it in Fig. 1a. Under this training paradigm, information never flows across segments in either the forward or backward pass. There are two critical limitations of using a fixed length context. First, the largest possible dependency length is upper bounded by the segment length, which is a few hundred on character-level language modeling (Al-Rfou et al., 2018).","A possible but unsophisticated way to handle this is to break up the full body of text into smaller, more manageable chunks, and train the model on each chunk separately, not taking into account any context from previous chunks. This is the approach used by Al-Rfou et al. (2018). We refer to this as the basic model and show it in Fig. 1a. With this training method, information never crosses between chunks in either direction. There are two major drawbacks to having a fixed context length. First, the longest attainable dependency is limited by the chunk size, which is a few hundred for character-level language modeling (Al-Rfou et al., 2018).","One rough but workable solution is to split the whole corpus into shorter, more manageable segments and only train the model within those segments, disregarding any contextual data from prior segments.

"Second, though it is possible to use padding to respect the sentence or other semantic boundaries, in practice it has been standard practice to simply chunk long text into fixed-length segments due to improved efficiency (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Al-Rfou et al., 2018). However, simply chunking a sequence into fixed-length segments will lead to the context fragmentation problem as discussed in Section 1.","Next, even though padding could be utilized to regard the limits of sentences or other semantic boundaries, in actuality the standard procedure has been to just split long text into fixed-length chunks because of enhanced speed (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Al-Rfou et al., 2018). But simply dividing a sequence into fixed-length pieces will result in the context fragmentation issue as talked about in Section 1.","Furthermore, despite the fact that it's feasible to use padding to respect sentence or other semantic borders, in practice the standard has been to just split long text into segments of a fixed length for better efficiency (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Al-Rfou et al., 2018). However, merely breaking up a sequence into fixed-length chunks will lead to the context fragmentation problem as described in Section 1.

But just dividing a sequence into fixed-length segments will cause the context fragmentation issue as explained in Section 1.",A,Transformer-XL,1
"To address the limitations of using a fixed-length context, we propose to introduce a recurrence mechanism to the Transformer architecture. During training, the hidden state sequence computed for the previous segment is fixed and cached to be reused as an extended context when the model processes the next new segment, as shown in Fig. 2a. Although the gradient still remains within a segment, this additional input allows the network to exploit information in the history, leading to an ability of modeling longer-term dependency and avoiding context fragmentation.","In order to handle the problems of using a context of a fixed size, we suggest adding a recurring process to the Transformer structure. While training, the hidden state sequence calculated for the prior segment is fixed and stored to be reused as a prolonged context when the model handles the next new segment, as depicted in Fig. 2a. Despite the gradient still staying within a segment, this extra input enables the network to utilize information in the history, resulting in an ability to model longer-term dependency and prevent context fragmentation.","To tackle the issues of utilizing a context of an unchanging length, our proposal is to bring in a repetitive operation into the Transformer design. As training proceeds, the hidden state order computed for the earlier portion is stabilized and cached to be used again as a drawn-out setting when the model tackles the subsequent fresh portion, as presented in Fig. 2a. Although the slope remains inside a portion, this supplementary contribution allows the network to take advantage of particulars in the historical background, conferring an aptitude for modeling more long-term dependency and impeding context disintegration. ","In order to address the shortcomings of employing a context of a rigid dimension, our recommendation is to introduce a recurring action into the Transformer blueprint. During training, the hidden state sequence calculated for the prior segment is fixed and stored to be recycled as an extended backdrop when the model handles the next novel segment, as depicted in Fig. 2a. Despite the gradient still residing within a segment, this additional input enables the network to leverage information in the history, bestowing an ability of modeling longer-lasting dependency and preventing context dissolution.",A,Transformer-XL,1
"During evaluation, at each step, the vanilla model also consumes a segment of the same length as in training, but only makes one prediction at the last position. Then, at the next step, the segment is shifted to the right by only one position, and the new segment has to be processed all from scratch. As shown in Fig. 1b, this procedure ensures that each prediction utilizes the longest possible context exposed during training, and also relieves context fragmentation issue encountered in training. However, this evaluation procedure is extremely expensive. We will show that our proposed architecture is able to substantially improve the evaluation speed.","When assessing performance, the standard model ingests a section of identical size to that used during learning at each phase, but solely generates one forecast at the final spot. Subsequently, in the next phase, the section is moved to the right by just a single location, and the new section needs to be handled completely from the beginning. As depicted in Fig. 1b, this process guarantees that each prediction leverages the longest available context revealed during learning, and also alleviates context fragmentation difficulties experienced during training. However, this evaluation methodology is extremely costly. We will demonstrate that our suggested design can substantially enhance the evaluation velocity.","During testing, the vanilla model takes in a chunk of the same length as in training at each iteration, but only produces one prediction at the final position. At the next iteration, the chunk is shifted right by only one spot, and the new chunk must be processed from scratch. As shown in Fig. 1b, this approach ensures each prediction uses the longest context seen in training, and avoids context fragmentation issues faced in training. But this testing procedure is very expensive. We will show our proposed architecture can greatly improve the testing speed.","When measuring performance, the basic model consumes a segment of equal size to training at each step, but only generates one forecast at the final spot. Next, the segment moves right one place, and the new segment must be handled from the start.

"This is analogous to truncated BPTT (Mikolov et al., 2010), a technique developed for training RNNLMs. However, different from truncated BPTT, our method caches a sequence of hidden states instead of the last one, and should be applied together with the relative positional encoding technique described in Section 3.3. Besides achieving extra long context and resolving fragmentation, another benefit that comes with the recurrence scheme is significantly faster evaluation. Specifically, during evaluation, the representations from the previous segments can be reused instead of being computed from scratch as in the case of the vanilla model. In our experiments on enwiki8, Transformer-XL is up to 1,800+ times faster than the vanilla model during evaluation (see Section 4).","This technique is similar to truncated BPTT (Mikolov et al., 2010), a method developed for training RNNLMs. However, unlike truncated BPTT which caches only the last hidden state, our approach stores a sequence of hidden states and should be used with the relative positional encoding method from Section 3.3.

" Finally, notice that the recurrence scheme does not need to be restricted to only the previous segment. In theory, we can cache as many previous segments as the GPU memory allows, and reuse all of them as the extra context when processing the current segment. While we found the idea presented in the previous subsection very appealing, there is a crucial technical challenge we haven’t solved in order to reuse the hidden states. That is, how can we keep the positional information coherent when we reuse the states?","Ultimately, recognize that the repetitive pattern does not have to be limited to just the prior portion.

"In order to avoid this failure mode, the fundamental idea is to only encode the relative positional information in the hidden states. Conceptually, the positional encoding gives the model a temporal clue or “bias” about how information should be gathered, i.e., where to attend. For the same purpose, instead of incorporating bias statically into the initial embedding, one can inject the same information into the attention score of each layer. More importantly, it is more intuitive and generalizable to define the temporal bias in a relative manner.","To prevent this problem, the key concept is to only encode the relative position data in the hidden layers. In essence, the position encoding provides the model with a temporal hint or ""prejudice"" about how to collect information, namely where to pay attention. Similarly, rather than statically integrating the bias into the initial embedding, one can inject the same details into the attention score of every layer. Most importantly, it is more intuitive and generalizable to characterize the temporal bias relatively.","In order to steer clear of this failure, the fundamental notion is to exclusively encode the comparative positional knowledge in the concealed states. In principle, the positional encoding furnishes the model with a chronological clue or ""partiality"" regarding how material ought to be compiled, specifically where to direct attention. For the same rationale, in lieu of solidifying prejudice into the initial embedding, one could infuse the same intelligence into the attention tally of each stratum. Above all, it is more instinctive and transferable to delineate the chronological bias relatively.","To sidestep this breakdown, the cardinal tenet is to only transcribe the proportional situational gen in the veiled tiers. At its core, the positional encoding endows the model with a temporal hint or ""penchant"" about how info should be amassed, viz. where to spotlight. Toward the same end, rather than ingraining bias statically into the initial embedding, one can suffuse the same dope into the attention score of each echelon. Critically, it is more intuitive and fungible to delineate the temporal bias relatively.",A,Transformer-XL,1
"Meanwhile, we won’t lose any temporal information, as the absolute position can be recovered recursively from relative distances.

Here, we offer a different derivation, arriving at a new form of relative positional encodings, which not only has a one-to-one correspondence to its absolute counterpart but also enjoys much better generalization empirically (see Section 4).","In the meantime, we will not miss any details about time, since we can recursively recover the exact position from relative distances.

"As a consequence, the expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting path, and yields a u-shaped architecture. The network does not have any fully connected layers and only uses the valid part of each convolution, i.e., the segmentation map only contains the pixels, for which the full context is available in the input image. This strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an overlap-tile strategy (see Figure 2). To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image.","Therefore, the expanding course of action mirrors the shrinking course of action, resulting in a u-shaped design. The neural network lacks fully connected strata and solely utilizes the applicable region of each convolution, meaning the segmentation blueprint exclusively encompasses pixels for which the complete setting is present in the input imagery. This plan permits the unbroken segmentation of arbitrarily massive images via an overlap-tile approach (see Figure 2). To predict the edge pixels, the absent context is approximated by reflecting the input image.","As a result, the broadening pathway is more or less a reflection of the narrowing pathway, forming a u-shaped architecture.

"This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory. As for our tasks there is very little training data available, we use excessive data augmentation by applying elastic deformations to the available training images. This allows the network to learn invariance to such deformations, without the need to see these transformations in the annotated image corpus. This is particularly important in biomedical segmentation, since deformation used to be the most common variation in tissue and realistic deformations can be simulated efficiently.","This method of splitting up images into smaller tiles is crucial for running the neural network on big images, because otherwise the image resolution would be constrained by the graphics card's memory capacity. Since there are very few labeled training images for our applications, we augment the data extensively by warping the existing training images elastically. This enables the network to become invariant to those distortions, without needing examples of them in the annotated image set. This invariance is especially useful in biomedical segmentation, as deformation tends to be the most prevalent variation in tissue, and realistic deformations can be simulated easily.","This approach of dividing images into tiles is vital for applying the neural network to large images, as the resolution would otherwise be limited by the memory available on the GPU. Given the scarcity of labeled training data for our tasks, we perform aggressive data augmentation by elastically transforming the available training images. That allows the network to learn to be unaffected by those transformations, without requiring instances of them in the annotated training set. That robustness is particularly valuable in biomedical segmentation, since deformation was the most frequent variation in tissue, and realistic deformations can be simulated efficiently.","This strategy of splitting images into tiles is essential for running the neural network on big images, since the resolution would otherwise be constrained by the memory on the graphics processing unit. Because there is very little annotated training data for our applications, we use extensive data augmentation by elastically warping the existing training images.

Also, multi-crop evaluation is complementary to dense evaluation due to different convolution boundary conditions: when applying a ConvNet to a crop, the convolved feature maps are padded with zeros, while in the case of dense evaluation the padding for the same crop naturally comes from the neighbouring parts of an image (due to both the convolutions and spatial pooling), which substantially increases the overall network receptive field, so more context is captured.","Furthermore, utilizing a large collection of crops, as implemented by Szegedy et al. (2014), can enhance precision, since it enables finer examination of the input image versus the fully-convolutional structure. Additionally, multi-crop assessment complements dense evaluation owing to differing convolution limits: applying a ConvNet to a crop involves zero-padding the convolved attribute charts, whereas dense evaluation provides natural padding for the same crop from adjacent image regions (due to both the convolutions and spatial pooling), substantially expanding the overall network receptive scope, capturing more context.","Moreover, leveraging a substantial crop set, per Szegedy et al. (2014), may improve performance, because it allows more thorough sampling of the input image compared to the fully-convolutional architecture. Also, multi-crop testing provides complementary benefits to dense testing due to different convolution constraints: convnet crop testing pads convolved maps with zeros, but dense testing naturally pads the same crop using surrounding image areas (via convolutions and spatial pooling), greatly increasing the overall receptive range and capturing more context.","Additionally, employing numerous crops, following Szegedy et al. (2014), can boost accuracy, since it enables finer probing of the input image versus fully-convolutional models. Furthermore, multi-crop analysis complements dense analysis owing to distinct convolution limits: applying a ConvNet to a crop zero-pads the convolved maps, but dense analysis organically pads the same crop using adjacent image areas (through convolutions and spatial pooling), substantially extending the overall receptive scope and incorporating more context.",A,VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE-SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION,1
